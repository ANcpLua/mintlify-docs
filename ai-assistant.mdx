# AI Assistant

The ANcpLua Framework documentation includes an AI-powered assistant that can help you find answers quickly.

## How to Use

Look for the AI assistant icon in the documentation interface. Click it to open the chat and ask questions about:

- Getting started with ANcpLua.NET.Sdk
- Configuring analyzers and understanding rules
- Using polyfills for legacy .NET versions
- MSBuild properties and configuration
- Testing utilities and patterns

## Example Questions

Here are some questions you can ask the assistant:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Getting Started" icon="rocket">
    "How do I get started with ANcpLua.NET.Sdk?"
  </Card>
  <Card title="Analyzers" icon="magnifying-glass">
    "What analyzers are included in the SDK?"
  </Card>
  <Card title="Polyfills" icon="puzzle-piece">
    "How do I use polyfills for netstandard2.0?"
  </Card>
  <Card title="Configuration" icon="gear">
    "What MSBuild properties can I configure?"
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Tips for Best Results

- Be specific in your questions
- Reference specific analyzer rules by ID (e.g., AL0001)
- Ask about particular SDK variants (Sdk, Sdk.Test, Sdk.Web)
- Request code examples when needed
